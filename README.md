## 🪫 Technical Limitations

- 👨‍🚒**NFSW** - for obvious reasons 
- 🔄 **APIs may break** – Piped/Invidious/Explode are not official; they can stop working if YouTube changes things
- 🚫 **No Google Account Integration at a certain level** – No history sync, likes, comments
- 🌍 **Geo & Trending Data** may be inaccurate
- ⏳ **Stream Quality Control** is limited (until `yt-dlp` is integrated)
- 🧩 **Subtitle & Playlist Support** coming soon
**Risk of Geo-IpArea Ban** - Doesn't have a proxy, as proxies are not free and are slow (researching workarounds)
